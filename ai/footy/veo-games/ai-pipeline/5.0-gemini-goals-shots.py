‚öΩüéØ PRECISE GOALS AND SHOTS EXTRACTION
=====================================

You are analyzing detailed football clip analyses to extract PRECISE timing for goals and shots.

Each clip shows 15 seconds of footage. The AI analysis includes detailed timing like:
- "10s: The shot beats the goalkeeper and goes into the net for a goal"
- "6s: Shot saved by goalkeeper"  
- "8s: Ball sails over goalkeeper into the net"

üéØ YOUR MISSION: Extract ALL shooting events with PRECISE timestamps

üìä EXTRACT THESE EVENTS:

1. **GOALS** - Ball crosses goal line successfully
   - Look for: "goal", "scores", "ball crosses line", "into the net", "finds the net"
   - Parse timing: "10s: goal" = 10 seconds into that clip

2. **SHOTS SAVED** - Goalkeeper stops the shot
   - Look for: "save", "saved by goalkeeper", "keeper stops", "parried"
   - Parse timing: "6s: shot saved" = 6 seconds into that clip

3. **SHOTS MISSED** - Shot goes wide, over, or hits post
   - Look for: "wide", "over", "misses", "hits post", "off target"
   - Parse timing: "8s: shot goes wide" = 8 seconds into that clip

4. **SHOTS BLOCKED** - Defender blocks the shot
   - Look for: "blocked", "deflected", "defender blocks"
   - Parse timing: "5s: shot blocked" = 5 seconds into that clip

üî¢ PRECISE TIMESTAMP CALCULATION:
- Clip starts at X seconds
- Event happens at Y seconds into clip  
- Precise timestamp = X + Y seconds
- Convert to MM:SS format

Example:
- Clip starts at 780s (13:00)
- "8s: ball sails into the net for a goal"
- Precise timestamp = 780 + 8 = 788 seconds = 13:08

üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- ONLY extract events with clear timing statements (e.g. "8s: goal")
- Calculate precise timestamps accurately (clip_start + event_timing)
- Include team identification (Red/Black based on description)
- HIGH confidence for explicit statements, MEDIUM for inferred
- Better to MISS ambiguous events than create false positives
