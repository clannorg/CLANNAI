**Assessment**:
The AI's shot detection appears quite active, identifying many instances of shots. However, a direct one-to-one match is difficult.

*   AI frequently detects shots as blocked/saved/missed *around* the times of ground truth shots. This suggests the AI *is* detecting shooting actions, but the timestamps are often off by a few seconds (outside the defined tolerance), and often reports the *outcome* of the shot rather than just the shot event itself.
*   There are some shots that our AI misses entirely, and conversely, many shots AI detects with no ground truth equivalent.
*   The quality of the AI shot descriptions, specifying block/save/miss, adds value, though the timing inaccuracy makes precise matching hard.

## ACCURACY METRICS

**Goals - Precision**: 50% (3 correct goals / 6 total detected goals)
**Goals - Recall**: 75% (3 correct goals / 4 total actual goals)
**Shots - Precision**: ~30% (rough estimate - many possible matches within a wider tolerance)
**Shots - Recall**: ~50% (rough estimate - many possible matches within a wider tolerance)

## KEY INSIGHTS

*   **What our AI does well**: The AI excels at identifying when a goal occurs if we incorporate the kickoff rule. The AI shows promise in identifying shooting events (shots), even providing contextual information like whether the shot was blocked, saved, or missed.

*   **What needs improvement**:
    *   **Goal Detection - Avoid Hallucinations:** The AI falsely identifies goals when there isn't a corresponding kickoff, indicating a fundamental misunderstanding of the game flow. The AI needs better event sequence logic.
    *   **Timestamp Accuracy:** The timestamp accuracy of all events needs significant improvement. The +/-30 second tolerance highlights an issue, particularly with shots.
    *   **Shot Detection - Consistency**: The AI struggles to detect all the shots that actually occurred.

*   **Specific recommendations**:
    *   **Refine Kickoff Validation:** Implement a stronger constraint: goals MUST be followed by a valid kickoff event detected within a shorter time window (e.g. 15 seconds). Reject any "goal" claims violating this constraint.
    *   **Time Synchronization Tuning**: Investigate potential synchronization issues between the AI analysis pipeline and the Veo camera timestamps. Calibrate the AI pipelineâ€™s timing mechanisms to more accurately align events with the ground truth data.
    *   **Training Data Review:** Examine the training data used for shot detection. Does the data adequately represent different types of shots (long-range, headers, volleys, etc.)? Ensure the dataset includes examples where shots are blocked, saved, and missed, and that these events are *distinctly* labeled. This will enhance the AI's ability to not only identify shots but also accurately classify their outcomes.
    *   **Contextual Awareness**: Train the AI to understand the flow of the game. The context clues surrounding the event will help to validate the predictions made by AI.
    *   **Consider a Two-Stage Approach:** First, focus on accurate event detection (identify *when* a shot occurs), then, in a second stage, classify the outcome (blocked, saved, missed, goal). This can improve the precision of event timing and overall accuracy.
