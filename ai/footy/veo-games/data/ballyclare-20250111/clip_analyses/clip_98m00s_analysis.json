The black team starts the match, passing the ball backward to their defenders to build possession from their own half while the red team organizes its defensive shape.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n*   **1s:** The referee blows the whistle, and the black team's player #10 takes the kick-off.\n*   **3s:** The ball is passed back to a black central defender just inside their own half.\n*   **6s:** The black team passes the ball sideways across their defensive line to maintain possession.\n*   **10s:** The referee signals as the black team continues to move the ball in their half.\n*   **14s:** A black midfielder receives a pass and turns, looking for forward options.",
