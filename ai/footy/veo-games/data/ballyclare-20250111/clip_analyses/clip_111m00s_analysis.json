  "events_analysis": "Based on my analysis of the 15-second clip, here is a breakdown of the events:\n\nThe clip shows the teams walking off the pitch at the end of a period of play, likely for halftime or the end of the match. There is no active gameplay, possession, or ball connections to report.\n\n*   **0s - 4s:** Players from both teams are seen milling around the center of the pitch after the whistle has apparently blown.\n*   **5s:** Players begin to walk off the field together, heading towards the covered stand in the background.\n*   **10s - 15s:** The teams continue to exit the field of play as the clip ends.",
