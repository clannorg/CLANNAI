The primary action is a group of players in orange bibs performing a \"rondo\" (keep-away) passing drill, while players in green kits warm up individually elsewhere on the field.\n\n- **0s - 15s:** Four players in orange bibs maintain possession in a continuous one-touch passing drill ('rondo'), while a fifth player in the middle tries to intercept the ball.\n- **3s:** A player in a green kit, positioned near the halfway line, takes a touch and passes the ball.\n- **8s:** Another player in a green kit, located on the far-left side of the pitch, kicks a long ball towards the center.\n- **12s:** The players in the orange rondo drill complete another quick pass across their circle.",
