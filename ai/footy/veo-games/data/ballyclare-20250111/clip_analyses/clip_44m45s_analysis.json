A team in black (wearing orange bibs) is engaged in a close-control passing drill, while the camera performs a slow pan from right to left across the field.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n- **2s:** A player from the Black team passes the ball to a teammate in the center of their warm-up circle.\n- **4s:** The central player quickly passes the ball back out to another teammate on the perimeter of the circle.\n- **6s:** The camera begins to pan left, moving its focus away from the passing drill.\n- **9s:** The camera's view is now centered on the halfway line, showing two players from the Red team standing in the center circle.\n- **14s:** The pan continues, showing the left half of the pitch as the Black team's warm-up drill remains visible on the far right.",
