The black team effectively defends the aerial threat and regains possession, starting their own build-up play from the back.\n\n- **3s:** A red player on the left passes the ball forward to a teammate.\n- **8s:** The red player (number 20) receives the ball and turns to face the opposition's goal.\n- **10s:** The red player plays a long, high pass forward into the attacking half.\n- **12s:** A red forward heads the long pass down towards the center.\n- **13s:** A black team defender intercepts the headed pass and takes control of the ball.\n- **15s:** The black player passes the ball back to a teammate on the sideline.",
