The play becomes scrappy, leading to a foul by a Black player and a free-kick being awarded to the Red team.\n\n- **3s:** A Black player attempts a sliding tackle, but the ball deflects to a nearby Red player.\n- **5s:** Another Red player falls to the ground while challenging for the now loose ball.\n- **7s:** As a Red player gathers the ball, he is brought down by a sliding tackle from a Black defender.\n- **8s:** The referee blows the whistle, awarding a free-kick to the Red team just outside the center circle.\n- **11s:** Players from both teams react to the foul as they reposition for the upcoming free-kick.",
