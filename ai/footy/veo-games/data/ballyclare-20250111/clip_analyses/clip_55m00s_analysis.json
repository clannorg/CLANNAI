The red team's players are casually passing the ball amongst themselves in their own half while the camera slowly pans from left to right across the pitch.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n\n*   **1s:** A red player makes a short pass to a teammate positioned centrally.\n*   **3s:** The central red player controls the ball and immediately passes it back to the first player.\n*   **6s:** The first red player receives the return pass.\n*   **7s - 15s:** The players remain in their warm-up positions with no further significant ball action as the camera continues its pan across the stadium and center circle.",
