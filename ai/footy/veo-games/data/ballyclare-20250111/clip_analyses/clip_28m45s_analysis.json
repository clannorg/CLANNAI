After regaining a loose ball following a tackle, the black team advances into the attacking half and slows the play to assess their options.\n\n*   **1s:** A black team player passes the ball forward from just inside their own half.\n*   **5s:** A red player executes a sliding tackle in the midfield, momentarily dispossessing the black team.\n*   **7s:** A different black team player collects the loose ball and dribbles past the halfway line.\n*   **13s:** The black player with the ball (wearing #7) slows down near the center circle, controlling possession and looking for a forward pass.",
