The black team then attempts a long, ambitious forward pass which is overhit and goes out of play.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n*   **2s**: Red player #8 wins a loose ball in the center circle following a tackle.\n*   **5s**: The red team's subsequent forward pass is intercepted by a black defender.\n*   **11s**: After a short back pass, a black player attempts a long, diagonal switch of play.\n*   **13s**: The long pass is unsuccessful and goes out of bounds for a red team throw-in.",
