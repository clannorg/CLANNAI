Here is a detailed analysis of the football clip provided.\n\nThe Red team wins possession from a throw-in and immediately launches a quick counter-attack with a long through-ball. The attack is thwarted as the Black team's goalkeeper anticipates the danger and gathers the ball before the Red attacker can reach it.\n\n*   **4s:** The Black team takes a throw-in from the left sideline into the midfield.\n*   **7s:** The Red team wins possession after a challenge near the sideline.\n*   **12s:** A Red midfielder plays a long, searching through-ball over the top of the Black team's defense.\n*   **15s:** The Black team's goalkeeper comes well off their line to successfully collect the ball, ending the attacking threat.",
