Players from both teams are scattered across the field, engaging in individual drills and light passing as the camera pans from right to left.\n\n- **0s**: Camera begins a slow pan from the right side of the pitch towards the left.\n- **1s**: Two players in orange kits pass a ball between each other near the center circle.\n- **9s**: A player in a red kit on the far left performs a stretching or warm-up drill, falling to the ground.\n- **13s**: A whistle is clearly heard, likely signaling the end of the warm-up period or for players to assemble.",
