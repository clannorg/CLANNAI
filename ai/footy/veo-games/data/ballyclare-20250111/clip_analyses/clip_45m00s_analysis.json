The players in red shirts and the goalkeeper are largely stationary in the center circle, not actively participating in the drill.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n*   **4s:** A player in an orange bib on the right side of the pitch controls a high ball.\n*   **7s:** The orange-bibbed player makes a simple ground pass to a central teammate.\n*   **9s:** The central player passes the ball to another teammate further on the right.\n*   **13s:** The players in orange bibs continue to pass the ball amongst themselves in a relaxed manner.",
