The referee immediately blows the whistle and awards a penalty kick, seemingly for a handball by a defending red player during the aerial challenge.\n\n- **3s:** The black team player strikes the ball from a free kick, sending a cross into the box.\n- **5s:** The ball arrives in the penalty area, where players from both teams challenge for it in the air.\n- **6s:** The referee blows the whistle and decisively points to the penalty spot.\n- **8s:** The referee's penalty signal is clearly visible as the black team players begin to celebrate the decision.",
