The red team quickly turns the interception into a fast counter-attack, advancing the ball into the black team's territory.\n\n- **4s:** The black team's player (No. 34) makes a forward pass from his own half under pressure.\n- **9s:** A red player intercepts the long pass with a header near the center circle.\n- **11s:** A teammate in red collects the loose ball from the header, securing possession.\n- **13s:** The red player with the ball drives forward as a black player slips and falls, opening up space for the attack.",
