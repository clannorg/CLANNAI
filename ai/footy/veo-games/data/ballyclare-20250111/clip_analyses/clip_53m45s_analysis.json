A group of players in orange bibs are in a circle performing a \"rondo\" (keep-away) passing drill, while a single player in a yellow bib acts as the defender in the middle, trying to intercept the ball.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates**\n*   **1s:** An orange-bibbed player passes the ball to a teammate to his left.\n*   **3s:** The ball is passed across the circle to another player in an orange bib.\n*   **5s:** A quick pass is made back across the drill to another orange-bibbed player.\n*   **7s:** A one-touch pass is completed between two orange-bibbed players.\n*   **10s:** The ball is passed from the right side of the circle back to a player on the left.\n*   **13s:** Another successful pass is made by the orange-bibbed players, keeping possession from the yellow-bibbed defender.",
