The camera pans to follow the play as a Black player carries the ball from their own half deep into the Red team's territory.\n\n*   **1s:** A Red player's attempt to advance on the left wing is immediately stopped by a Black defender.\n*   **3s:** The Black team clears the ball, and a player collects it near the halfway line to start a counter-attack.\n*   **7s:** The Black player with the ball dribbles at speed past the center circle and into the Red team's half.\n*   **11s:** The play slows down on the right flank as the Red team gets defenders back into position, neutralizing the immediate threat.\n*   **14s:** Players from both teams begin to reset their positions across the field.",
