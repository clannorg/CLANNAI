- **Evidence:** Goals at 05:30 (free kick header), 23:30 (direct free kick), and numerous free kick shots (15:15, 19:30, 32:30, etc.). Free kicks generated corner kicks as well (05:15).
- **Impact:** Free kicks provide consistent scoring opportunities and put pressure on the opposition. The goal variety from free kicks (direct and headed) makes Red Team unpredictable.
- **Continue Doing:** Designate multiple free kick takers for different ranges and angles. Practice set-piece routines to maximize chances of scoring directly or creating secondary opportunities.

**2. Attacking Down the Left Wing**
- **Evidence:** Goals at 07:30 (attack down the left wing) and 43:00 (attack down left wing leading to a pass across the goal). Multiple shots originated from the left side of the penalty area (02:15, 04:00, 25:15).
- **Impact:** Consistent attacking threat down the left side stretches the opponent's defense, creating scoring opportunities.
- **Continue Doing:** Focus training on overlapping runs and combination play down the left flank. Exploit the numerical advantage when available.

**3. Possession in the Attacking Third**
- **Evidence:** "02:30 - The Red team maintains possession in the attacking third...to probe the Yellow team's defense." Several attacking sequences originate from sustained possession.
- **Impact:** Allows Red to dictate pace, probe for defensive weaknesses, and create scoring chances with sustained pressure.
- **Continue Doing:** Promote patience in possession and encourage players to recycle the ball when a clear opportunity doesn't present itself.
