Combine these football match analysis files into a single chronological timeline.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Use match time format: "0m48s:" (minutes and seconds from match start)
- Categorize: GOAL (ball crosses line), SHOT (any attempt), SAVE (goalkeeper saves)
- For goals: Look for shots that result in ball crossing goal line, referee whistle, or clear goal celebration
- Be slightly less conservative with goal detection - if it looks like a goal, call it a goal
- Remove duplicates
- Include statistics at the end

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```
GAME298_0601 EVENTS TIMELINE
==================================================

0m09s: Shot on goal, saved by goalkeeper - SHOT
0m48s: Goal scored by team A - GOAL

Total Events: 2
