This clip provides a time-lapse overview of a football match, showing the general flow and movement of players across the entire pitch. Due to the accelerated nature of the video, it is not possible to track a single continuous play or attribute possession to a specific team as multiple kits are on the field and the action is not in real-time. The clip shows various phases of play unfolding rapidly across the field.
