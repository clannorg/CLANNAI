Players from the black/green team are casually passing the ball between themselves in their own half, while players from the red team are scattered and not applying any pressure.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n*   **1s:** A player from the red team, who was sitting on the pitch, gets to his feet.\n*   **5s:** A player in a black/green kit receives a slow pass on the left side of the field.\n*   **8s:** The black/green player makes a simple ground pass forward to a teammate.\n*   **12s:** The teammate plays a one-touch return pass back to the first player.\n*   **14s:** The first player controls the return pass, continuing the relaxed possession sequence.",
