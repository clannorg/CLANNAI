Players are casually passing the ball in separate groups rather than engaging in a competitive match.\n\n- **1s**: A player in a black shirt and green bib on the left side of the pitch passes the ball.\n- **5s**: A red team player controls a pass near the center circle.\n- **7s**: The red player makes a short pass to a teammate positioned to the right.\n- **11s**: After a one-touch return, the initial red player receives the ball back.\n- **14s**: The ball is passed to a third red player now inside the center circle.",
