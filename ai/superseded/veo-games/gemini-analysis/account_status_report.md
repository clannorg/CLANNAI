# Google Account Status Report

**Date:** July 28, 2025  
**Pipeline:** Veo Games Video Analysis  

## 🔍 Account Analysis

### Current Status: **FREE TIER**

**Evidence from API Error:**
- Error Code: `429 - Quota exceeded`
- Quota Metric: `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/generate_content_free_tier_requests`
- Daily Limit: **50 requests**
- Reset: Every 24 hours

### What Happened:
- Processed **47 clips** (~12 minutes of video)
- Hit the **50 request/day limit**
- 10 clips remaining to complete 15-minute test

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Free Tier Limitations:
- **50 requests/day** = ~12.5 minutes of video analysis
- Sufficient for small tests, not full matches
- Resets at midnight UTC

### Paid Tier Costs:
| Analysis Type | Clips | Cost | Notes |
|---------------|-------|------|-------|
| **Complete 15-min test** | 10 extra | **$0.004** | Minimal cost |
| **Full 60-min match** | 240 | **$0.07** | After free tier |
| **Full 90-min match** | 360 | **$0.11** | After free tier |

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 24h):
1. **Enable billing** - costs are negligible ($0.004 to finish test)
2. **Keep current model** (`gemini-2.0-flash-exp`) - optimal balance
3. **Complete 15-minute analysis** to validate approach

### Long-term Strategy:
1. **Paid API** for production use
2. **Hybrid approach** for large-scale analysis:
   - Screen with `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (cheap)
   - Deep analysis with `gemini-2.5-flash-exp` (better quality)
   - Synthesis with `gemini-2.5-pro` (insights)

## 📊 Key Insights

**Costs are NOT the constraint** - even premium analysis costs <$2 per full match.

**The real constraints are:**
- Free tier daily limits (50 requests)
- Processing time (~1 hour per match)  
- Video quality/compression optimization

**Bottom line:** Enable billing for seamless development. The costs are minimal compared to the insights generated.
