# MEGA-GEMINI PIPELINE APPROACH

## Current Problem
Our v2 pipeline makes **6 separate Gemini calls** in sequence, creating a "telephone game" where:
- Step 4: Analyze clips â†’ misses goals (0/5 detected)
- Step 6: Validate goals â†’ can't validate what wasn't detected  
- Step 8: Extract other events â†’ works but no context
- Step 9: Convert to web format â†’ limited by previous steps
- Step 11: Tactical analysis â†’ limited context

**Result: Missing 5/5 goals, 18/18 shots despite VEO ground truth available**

## Mega-Gemini Solution

**Replace steps 4-11 with ONE context-aware Gemini call**

### Single Input Package
```
INPUTS TO MEGA-GEMINI:
â”œâ”€â”€ 5_complete_timeline.txt (90min in 600x15s chunks)
â”œâ”€â”€ 1_veo_ground_truth.json (23 VEO events: 5 goals, 18 shots)  
â”œâ”€â”€ meta/match_meta.json (teams, duration, colors)
â””â”€â”€ team_mapping: Blue vs Black/White
```

### Single Output Package

}
```

## Benefits

### ðŸŽ¯ **Accuracy**
- Cross-validation: Gemini sees BOTH AI timeline AND VEO ground truth
- Context-aware: Full match knowledge for better event detection
- Smart reconciliation: "VEO says goal at 32:48, let me check timeline around that time"

### âš¡ **Speed** 
- 1 Gemini call vs 6 separate calls
- No inter-step dependencies 
- Parallel processing of all analysis types

### ðŸ”’ **Deterministic**
- Single source of truth
- Consistent team mappings
- No prompt drift between steps

### ðŸ§  **Intelligent**
- "I see VEO detected a goal at 32:48, checking timeline clips around 1968s..."
- "Timeline shows celebration and center-circle restart after this event"
- "AI missed this goal but evidence is clear in timeline"

## Mega-Prompt Strategy

```
You are analyzing a 90-minute football match. You have:

1. COMPLETE MATCH TIMELINE: 600 15-second clips analyzed by AI
2. VEO GROUND TRUTH: 23 verified events (5 goals, 18 shots)  
3. TEAMS: Blue (blue jerseys) vs Black/White (striped jerseys)

YOUR TASK: Produce comprehensive match analysis with perfect accuracy by cross-referencing AI timeline against VEO truth.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Every VEO goal/shot MUST appear in final output (they are ground truth)
- For each VEO event, find supporting evidence in timeline
- AI timeline may miss events - use VEO times to locate them
- Reject AI events not supported by VEO (unless overwhelming evidence)
- Generate tactical insights from validated events only

OUTPUT FORMAT: Single JSON with validated_events, web_events_array, tactical_analysis, accuracy_metrics
```

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create `mega_analyzer.py`**
   - Reads: timeline + VEO + metadata
   - Calls: Gemini 2.5 Pro with full context
   - Outputs: Complete analysis JSON

2. **Test on current match**
   - Input: Our 600 clips + VEO 23 events
   - Expected: Find all 5 goals, 18 shots
   - Validate: Web format + tactical analysis

3. **Replace pipeline steps 4-11**
   - Keep: 1-3 (data + clips)  
   - Replace: 4-11 with single mega call
   - Maintain: Same output contracts

## Expected Results

- **Goals detected**: 5/5 (vs current 0/5)
- **Shots detected**: 18/18 (vs current 0/18) 
- **Processing time**: ~2 minutes (vs ~15 minutes)
- **Accuracy**: Perfect precision/recall on VEO events
- **Context**: Rich tactical insights from complete match view
