### REJECTED CLAIMS

*   **69:21-69:30 - Alleged Shot:** "a Black/White player taking a shot from distance".
    *   **Reason for Rejection:** This description appears within a montage of unrelated clips. There is no continuous play, no specified outcome (save, miss, block), and not enough context to validate it as a singular, verifiable event.
*   **113:45 & 114:00 - Alleged Goal:** "Goal scored by the Black/White team."
    *   **Reason for Rejection:** This claim is repeated across two clips but lacks the mandatory supporting evidence. According to the validation rules, a goal must be followed by a kickoff from the center circle. The subsequent clips at **114:15** and **114:30** describe a free kick and a corner kick, not a center-circle restart. This is a clear AI hallucination.

### ANALYSIS SUMMARY

The match between the Blue team and the Black/White team appears to have ended in a **1-1 draw**.

**Key Moments:**
*   The Black/White team opened the scoring around the **46:15** mark by converting a penalty kick.
*   The Blue team found an equalizer around the **65:30** mark, with the goal being celebrated before a restart from the center.
*   The Black/White team was the more dominant attacking force throughout the match, registering at least 25 shots towards the Blue team's goal. However, they were frequently wasteful, with numerous shots blocked, missed, or saved by the Blue goalkeeper, who had a busy and effective game.
*   The Blue team was more clinical, scoring with one of their few validated chances.
*   A notable event occurred at **99:16**, where a Blue team player was shown a red card, meaning they likely played the end of the match with ten players.
