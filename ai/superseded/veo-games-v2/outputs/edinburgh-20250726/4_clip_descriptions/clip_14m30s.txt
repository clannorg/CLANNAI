The Black/White team is on the attack inside the Blue team's penalty area. A shot or cross is blocked by a Blue defender. A Black/White player falls in the box, but the referee waves play on. The Blue team clears the danger, and the game resets, likely for a goal kick, as players from both teams move back into position.
