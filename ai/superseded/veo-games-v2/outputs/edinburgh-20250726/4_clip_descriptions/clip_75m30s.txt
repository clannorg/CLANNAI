The clip opens with the conclusion of a Blue team corner kick from the left. The Black/White team successfully defends the set piece, heading the ball clear of their penalty area. The Black/White team then gains control of the loose ball and establishes possession in the midfield, with both teams beginning to reorganise their positions.
