The Black/White team starts with possession in midfield and attempts a long pass forward. The Blue team defends and gains possession, starting a counter-attack up the left wing. This attack is broken up by the Black/White team, but the Blue team quickly recovers the ball near the halfway line, ending the clip in possession.
