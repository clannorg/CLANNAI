The Black/White team heads the ball forward from an aerial duel in midfield. The Blue team intercepts the loose ball and starts an attack, but possession is quickly turned over. The Black/White team then counter-attacks into the Blue team's half before a Blue defender intercepts a pass and clears the ball upfield. The play consists of a rapid transition between the two teams in the middle third of the pitch.
