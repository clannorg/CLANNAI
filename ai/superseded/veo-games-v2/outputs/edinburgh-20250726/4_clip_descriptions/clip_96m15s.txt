The clip shows a period of transitional play with both teams exchanging possession. It begins with the Black/White team attacking, but the Blue team wins the ball back near the halfway line. The Blue team's subsequent forward pass is intercepted by the Black/White team, who then launch an attack down the right wing. The Blue team defends and clears the danger, initiating a counter-attack that progresses into the Black/White team's half before possession is lost again.
