Please note: The analysis is severely limited by the incomplete "AI TIMELINE" provided. Only the 00:00 entry was available, which means no fouls, corners, cards, substitutions, or team-specific actions (other than the initial possession) could be identified. Additionally, the VEO data for goals and shots does not include team attribution, so it is impossible to determine which team scored or took which shot. The mapping of "Red team" to "Yellow team" and "White team" to "Blue team" from the AI timeline snippet is an assumption to maintain consistent team naming as requested.

### MEGA_SUMMARY.TXT ###
Match overview:

Match: Yellow team vs Blue team
Final Score: Undetermined (Team attribution for goals is missing from provided data)
Duration: 104 minutes (including stoppage)

Key Statistics:
- Goals: 2 (Total from VEO)
- Shots: 29 (Total from VEO)
- Other stats: None available from incomplete AI Timeline.

Match Narrative:
This match analysis is significantly limited due to the incomplete nature of the AI Timeline provided, which only included the initial 00:00 entry. Therefore, a comprehensive narrative of game flow, tactical nuances, and detailed event descriptions (such as fouls, corners, cards, substitutions, or who scored which goal) is not possible.

Based solely on the VEO ground truth, the match featured a total of 2 goals and 29 shots on goal. The first goal occurred at 36:29, and the second goal was scored much later in the game at 84:56, suggesting a potentially tight contest that went down to the wire. Shots were distributed throughout the match, indicating periods of offensive pressure from both sides, but without team attribution, specific patterns or which team dominated cannot be identified. The only team-specific action from the AI timeline noted the Blue team (White team in the AI snippet) casually passing the ball in their own half at the very start of the match, preparing for kick-off.
