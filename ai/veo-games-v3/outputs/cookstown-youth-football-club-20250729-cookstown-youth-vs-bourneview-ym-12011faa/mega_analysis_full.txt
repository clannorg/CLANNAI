The 90-minute football match, extending to approximately 104 minutes with stoppages, saw the Yellow team emerge victorious with a dominant 3-0 scoreline against the Blue team.

They continued their scoring run with a third goal at 81:50, showcasing their consistent pressure and ability to convert chances.

They did create several significant opportunities themselves, including a free kick that rattled the crossbar at 34:32 and a penalty award at 35:41, but ultimately failed to convert any of their 8 recorded shots into goals. The match featured a fair amount of physical play, resulting in 15 fouls called against both teams, and even a brief interruption by a dog on the pitch at 61:12. The Yellow team's strategic use of long balls and flank attacks, combined with their proficiency in dead-ball situations, proved to be the decisive factor in securing a comfortable win.
