Play is contested in midfield with both teams exchanging possession. A Blue team player successfully tackles a Black/White team player, but the Black/White team quickly regains control. The Blue team then intercepts a pass, only for the Black/White team to immediately intercept the subsequent pass and maintain possession as the clip ends.
