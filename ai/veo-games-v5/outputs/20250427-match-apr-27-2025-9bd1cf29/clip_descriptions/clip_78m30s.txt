At 0 seconds, the video begins with a wide shot of a football match where play is stopped. Players from the white jersey team and the red and black jersey team are spread out across the pitch, mostly standing still or walking slowly. The referee in a dark blue top is in the center-left area of the field.

At 5 seconds, a player in a white jersey with a red scrum cap-style headguard bends over on the left side of the field.

At 9 seconds, another player in a white jersey, standing next to the player with the headguard, also bends over. Most players remain in their general positions.

At 14 seconds, a football rolls into the frame from the bottom right corner, but no active play resumes during the clip.
