      "match_evidence": "Corduff's opening goal came directly from a free kick, demonstrating Dalkey's vulnerability to set pieces.  While they didn't concede from corners, they gave away 13 free kicks, which provided many platforms for Corduff.",
      "why_needed": "Tightening up set-piece defending, particularly around free kicks near the box, will reduce the likelihood of conceding crucial goals.",

      "focus_areas": "Quick transition from attack to defense, compact shape",
      "match_evidence": "While not explicitly stated, Dalkey conceded two penalties, suggesting defensive lapses when transitioning from attack to defense.  Corduff's counter-punching style relies on exploiting such transitions.",
      "why_needed": "Improving defensive organization and composure after losing possession will limit Corduff's opportunities for quick counter-attacks and reduce fouls in the box.",
