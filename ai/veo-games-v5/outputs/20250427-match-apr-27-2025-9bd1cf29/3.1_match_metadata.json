  "match_summary": "The 90-minute football match between Dalkey and Corduff saw Corduff emerge victorious with a 2-0 scoreline, based on the VEO verified goals. The first half was a competitive affair, with both teams building attacks and creating chances. Corduff broke the deadlock in the 37th minute (36:45), taking a 1-0 lead after a period of attacking play, as Dalkey restarted the match from kickoff. Dalkey showed strong possession and often initiated play from their defense, but struggled to convert their attacking efforts into verified goals.\n\nThe second half continued with Dalkey pressing forward, accumulating numerous throw-ins and free kicks, and attempting shots on goal. However, Corduff's defense held firm, thwarting many of Dalkey's advances and often intercepting passes to launch their own counter-attacks. As the game neared its conclusion, Corduff solidified their lead, scoring their second and final VEO verified goal in the 86th minute (85:11) after progressing the ball into the penalty area, sealing their victory. Despite Dalkey's consistent pressure and numerous shot attempts throughout the match, they were unable to find the back of the net against a resilient Corduff side."
