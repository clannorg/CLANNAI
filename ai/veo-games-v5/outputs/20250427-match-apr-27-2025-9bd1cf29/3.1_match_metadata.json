  "match_summary": "The match saw Corduff emerge victorious with a 2-0 scoreline, with both goals being VEO-verified. Corduff opened the scoring late in the first half at 36:45, following an attacking play that began with a free kick. Their second and final goal came late in the second half at 85:11, after a build-up into the penalty area.\n\nDespite the score, Dalkey was highly active in attacking, registering a significant number of shots (47) throughout the game, compared to Corduff's 22. Dalkey had numerous opportunities, including several shots saved by the Corduff goalkeeper and many that went wide. Corduff, while having fewer shots, demonstrated clinical finishing in the two moments that counted. Key defensive moments included Corduff committing 10 fouls, leading to 2 penalties awarded against them, and Dalkey committing 8 fouls, leading to 3 penalties awarded against them.\n\nThe midfield battle was intense, with both teams frequently winning and losing possession. Dalkey led in turnovers (45 vs 42), indicating their persistent efforts to win back the ball and launch attacks. Set pieces were also a feature, with Dalkey having more free kicks than Corduff, and both teams earning two corners each."
