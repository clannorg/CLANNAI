The video shows a wide, static view of an empty football pitch at night before the camera begins to pan.\n\n*   **1s - 10s**: The camera holds a fixed, wide shot of the football pitch, centered on the halfway line. Spectators are visible in the stands, but no match is being played.\n*   **11s**: The camera begins a slow pan to the right, moving its view across the empty pitch.\n*   **15s**: The clip ends as the camera continues its pan across the field.",
