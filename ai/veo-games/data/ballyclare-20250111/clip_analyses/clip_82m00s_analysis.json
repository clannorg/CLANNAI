The black team's defense reads the play well, wins the initial aerial challenge, and establishes controlled possession in their own half.\n\n- **2s:** A red player receives the kickoff pass just inside the center circle.\n- **4s:** The red player lofts a long, high pass forward toward the right attacking channel.\n- **8s:** The black team's central defender cleanly wins the header against a red attacker.\n- **11s:** A black player on the right side of the defense controls the headed clearance.\n- **14s:** Under pressure from a closing red player, the black defender makes a short pass back to a teammate to secure possession.",
