A misjudged defensive header by a black team player allows the red team to regain possession and quickly play a through ball down the left wing, putting their attacker in a threatening position.\n\n- **5s:** A red player plays a long, high ball forward from inside the center circle.\n- **7s:** A black team player in midfield mistimes a defensive header, sending the ball backward toward his own goal.\n- **8s:** A red attacker (#11) gains control of the loose ball in the attacking half.\n- **12s:** The red player plays a through pass into the space on the left flank.\n- **14s:** A running red teammate receives the pass just outside the penalty area on the left side.",
