The primary focus is a small group of players in orange bibs performing a rondo (a \"piggy-in-the-middle\" passing drill), maintaining possession while a single player in yellow acts as the defender trying to intercept the ball.\n\n**Key Timing Estimates:**\n- **1s:** A player in an orange bib on the left side of the circle passes the ball.\n- **3s:** The receiving player makes a one-touch pass to the teammate on the right.\n- **6s:** The ball is passed back to the player at the top of the rondo circle.\n- **9s:** A pass is made across the circle to the player at the bottom left.\n- **13s:** The ball is passed back to the player at the top of the circle, continuing the drill.",
