### **REJECTED CLAIMS**

*   **Goal at 05:12 (Red):** Rejected. No kickoff is mentioned after the event. The subsequent clip describes a "long free kick" restart, which contradicts a goal.
*   **Goal at 18:45 (Blue):** Rejected. This clip only describes players "resetting for a kickoff," but there is no clip describing the actual goal. The prior clips do not show a goal being scored.
*   **Goal at 48:45 (Blue):** Rejected. Contradictory evidence. The preceding clip (48:30) describes a *save* by the Blue goalkeeper, and the following clip (49:00) describes a *goal kick*, not a kickoff.
*   **Goals/Shots between 50:15 - 61:00:** Rejected. Multiple clips in this period (e.g., 56:30, 58:00, 118:15) explicitly state it is a "warm-up," "training session," or "not a match." All events here are considered non-game actions.
*   **Goal at 73:55 (Red):** Rejected. The penalty is scored, but no kickoff follows. The next clip at 74:00 is a *goal kick*, which is the incorrect restart. The goal cannot be validated.
*   **Goal at 90:38 (Blue):** Rejected. No kickoff is mentioned in any of the subsequent clips.
*   **Goal at 91:28 (Blue):** Rejected. No kickoff follows. The next clip at 91:30 describes play restarting from a *goal kick*.
*   **Goal at 105:10 (Blue):** Rejected. No kickoff evidence. The following clips describe free kicks and defensive clearances.
*   **Goal at 109:02 (Blue):** Rejected. No kickoff evidence in any subsequent clips.
*   **Goal at 115:23 (Red):** Rejected. The scored penalty is followed by a *goal kick* at 115:30, not a kickoff.
*   **Penalty Award at 30:05 (Blue):** Rejected. The penalty is awarded, but the timeline never shows it being taken. Subsequent clips show a kickoff reset, which is an illogical sequence.
*   **Penalty Award at 40:27 (Red):** Rejected. The penalty is awarded, but the timeline never shows it being taken and the next clip shows the opposing team taking a free kick.

### **ANALYSIS SUMMARY**

Based on the validated events, the match between Red/Claret and Blue/Black was an eventful and closely contested 2-2 draw.

**Final Score:** Red/Claret Team 2 - 2 Blue/Black Team

The Blue/Black team opened the scoring at **80:13** with a goal from a wing attack. The Red/Claret team equalized late in the game at **92:42** by capitalizing on a loose ball in the box. The scoring was not over, as the Blue/Black team quickly retook the lead at **95:04** with a shot from distance, only for the Red/Claret team to level the score again with a converted penalty at **100:07**.

A key feature of the match was the high number of saved shots, particularly penalties. Goalkeepers on both sides were instrumental, with at least three penalties being saved (**49:37**, **82:22**, **91:13**) in addition to numerous saves from open play. The timeline indicates a very active game with frequent attacks, shots, and crucial defensive interventions.
