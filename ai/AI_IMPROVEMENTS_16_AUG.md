# AI Improvements - 16 Aug 2025

## Priority Tasks

- ✅ **Team Name Consistency**: Fixed confusing Yellow/Blue mapping - now uses actual team names throughout
- **Accuracy Assessment**: Restore AI vs VEO comparison (lost in v2→v3 migration)
- **Better Insights**: Improve tactical analysis delivered to users  
- **Final Score in Metadata**: Add winning team + score to match_metadata.json
- **Polish Web App**: Continue UI improvements for customer demos

## Fixed Today
- AI now uses "East London Ballers" instead of "Yellow team" in all outputs
- Team colors from manual setup now passed to AI clip analysis
- Consistent naming from clips → events → tactical analysis → webapp

## Notes
- v3 pipeline works but missing accuracy validation from v2
- Need better coaching insights beyond basic team strengths/weaknesses
- Metadata should show "East London Ballers 2-1 Opposition" format
