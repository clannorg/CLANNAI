The Black/White team and the opposing team in dark kits are on the pitch. The scene appears to be a pre-match warm-up or a break in play, as different groups of players are engaged in separate activities. The Black/White team is practicing attacking movements and passing on the left side of the pitch, while a player from the dark-kitted team stands with a ball at the halfway line.
