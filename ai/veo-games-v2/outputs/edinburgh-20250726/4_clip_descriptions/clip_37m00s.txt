The clip begins with an aerial ball being cleared from the Blue team's defensive third. The ball travels to midfield where players from both the Blue team and the Black/White team engage in a series of headers. Neither team manages to establish controlled possession on the ground as they contest the ball in the air around the halfway line for the remainder of the clip.
