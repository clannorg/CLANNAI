The clip opens with the Black/White team attacking the Blue team's penalty area, but the Blue team clears the ball. Possession is then contested by both teams in the midfield, with the ball being moved around through a series of headers and short passes. Neither team establishes firm control as they both vie for possession in the middle of the park.
