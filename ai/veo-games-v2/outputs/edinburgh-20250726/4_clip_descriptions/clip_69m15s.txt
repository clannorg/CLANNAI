The clip is a montage of different moments, not a single continuous play.

00:00 - 00:06: Black/White team takes a throw-in on the right sideline in the Blue team's half. The ball is controlled by a Black/White player.
00:06 - 00:15: The video then cuts to several different, disconnected plays. These brief sequences show both teams in possession at various points on the field, including a Black/White player taking a shot from distance and the Blue team defending several attacks.
