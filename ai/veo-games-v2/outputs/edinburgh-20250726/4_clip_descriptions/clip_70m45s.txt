The Blue team starts with possession in the midfield, but their forward pass is intercepted. The Black/White team attempts a quick counter-attack with a long ball down the right flank, which is headed away by a Blue defender. The ball remains in the middle of the pitch, with possession changing hands between the two teams until the Black/White team establishes control as the clip ends.
