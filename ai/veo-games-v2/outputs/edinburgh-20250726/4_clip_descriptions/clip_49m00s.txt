The clip opens with the Blue team in possession in the Black/White team's half. The camera continuously zooms out, transitioning from a view of the center of the pitch to a very wide, high-angle shot of the entire field. Due to the extreme change in camera perspective and distance, it is not possible to follow the subsequent play in detail.
