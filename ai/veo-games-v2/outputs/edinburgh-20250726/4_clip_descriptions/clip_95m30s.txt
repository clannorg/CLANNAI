The clip consists of a continuous and wide-ranging pan across the football pitch. Players from both the Blue and Black/White teams are seen positioned in various areas, but the camera movement does not follow a specific phase of play. Consequently, no team can be identified as having possession, and no main actions like passing or attacking are shown.
