The clip shows a period of transitional play that settles into possession for the Blue team. The Black/White team briefly has the ball on the right wing, but the Blue team wins it back in the midfield. After another quick change of possession, the Blue team establishes control and begins building an attack from their own half, passing the ball across the pitch.
