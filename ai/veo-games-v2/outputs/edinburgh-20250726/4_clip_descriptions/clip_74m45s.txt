This clip is a time-lapse showing various stages of play rather than a continuous 15-second segment. It begins with both teams contesting for possession in midfield following what appears to be a long kick upfield. The view then rapidly shifts multiple times, showing players from both teams repositioning and moving around the pitch during different phases of the game. Due to the time-lapsed nature, it's not possible to track continuous possession or specific actions.
