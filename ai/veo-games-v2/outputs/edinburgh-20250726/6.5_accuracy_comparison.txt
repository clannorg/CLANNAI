**Matches**:
*   45:53 Ground Truth matches 46:15 AI Detection (Within ~22-second tolerance, close enough to be considered a true positive given the context of a penalty and resulting celebration).

**False Positives**:
*   65:30 (AI detected a Blue team goal, which is NOT present in ground truth data)

**False Negatives**:
*   None (Our AI detected the actual goal, despite timestamp variance)

**Assessment**:

The AI detected a significant number of shots, with decent timestamp proximity to the ground truth data. The AI does reasonably well at detecting shots *in general*, but struggles with these problems:
*   Discriminating between shots on goal vs shots that are blocked/missed/saved.  This information isn't consistently extracted.
*   Incomplete/inaccurate timestamping (the AI's timestamps are often off by several seconds/tens of seconds).
*   The AI is including shots that *did not go on goal*.
*   Many shots on goal from the ground truth are not represented in the AI data.

## ACCURACY METRICS

**Goals - Precision**: 50% (1 correct goal / 2 total detected goals)
**Goals - Recall**: 100% (1 correct goal / 1 total actual goal)
**Shots - Precision**: Difficult to quantify exactly due to the variety of shot outcomes being included in the AI data, but is *roughly* in the 40-50% range.  Our AI is detecting many shots, but also detecting a lot of events that are *not* shots on goal.
**Shots - Recall**: Difficult to quantify exactly due to the imprecise nature of matching events, but is *roughly* in the 60-70% range, perhaps lower. Our AI is missing many of the shots included in the ground truth.

## KEY INSIGHTS

*   **What our AI does well:**
    *   Detecting the presence of goals within a reasonable timeframe (although not always perfectly accurate).
    *   Identifying many of the shot events within a match, demonstrating its ability to recognize attacking play.

*   **What needs improvement:**
    *   **Timestamp accuracy is crucial.** The AI needs to be more precise in pinpointing the exact moments of events.
    *   **Distinguishing between "Shot on Goal" vs other shot types.** The AI needs to be able to differentiate a shot *on target* from a blocked shot, a missed shot, a saved shot, or a cross. The precision of shot detection needs to improve significantly.
    *   **Reduce false positives.** The AI is hallucinating non-existent goals.
    *   **Increase shot recall.** Many shots on goal are not even present in the AI shot list.
    *   **Improve accuracy of shot type classification (header vs foot shot).**
    *   **Reduce hallucinated red cards and other claims.**

*   **Specific recommendations:**
    *   **Refine the AI model's training data:** Focus on providing more examples of "Shot on Goal" events *specifically*, with clear differentiations from blocked shots, missed shots, crosses, etc.
    *   **Implement stricter timestamp validation rules:** Develop algorithms that can more accurately synchronize the AI's event detections with the video timeline. Consider using more advanced video analysis techniques to identify frame-by-frame changes indicative of a shot.
    *   **Introduce a "confidence score" for event detections:** This would allow for filtering out lower-confidence detections that are more likely to be false positives.
    *   **Implement a system for validating key game events (especially goals) using multiple sources of evidence:** The AI should look for corroborating information (e.g., the ball entering the net, players celebrating, a kickoff from the center circle) before definitively labeling an event as a goal.
    *   **Focus on the primary task of extracting the most important events like goals and shots *accurately*,** before moving on to more nuanced event types. Quality over quantity!
    *   **Double check validation rules.** The AI incorrectly marked a rejected claim as a goal.
