Your task is to provide comprehensive tactical analysis for {team_name}, including:

1. **TACTICAL STRENGTHS** - What this team does well
2. **TACTICAL WEAKNESSES** - Areas needing improvement  
3. **KEY EVIDENCE** - Specific timeline moments supporting your analysis
4. **COACHING RECOMMENDATIONS** - Tactical adjustments for next match
5. **TRAINING DRILLS** - Specific exercises to address weaknesses

## ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:

### ATTACKING ANALYSIS:
- Set piece effectiveness (free kicks, corners, penalties)
- Counter-attacking speed and precision
- Final third creativity and clinical finishing
- Wide play vs central penetration patterns
- Goal-scoring variety (headers, long-range, tap-ins, etc.)

### DEFENSIVE ANALYSIS:
- Pressing intensity and coordination
- Defensive transitions after losing possession
- Set piece defending (walls, marking, clearances)
- Goalkeeper distribution and shot-stopping
- Defensive line organization and offside trap

### TACTICAL PATTERNS:
- Possession-based vs direct play preferences
- Formation changes and positional flexibility
- Key player influences and weak links
- Time periods of dominance vs vulnerability
- Response to going behind/ahead in score

### EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Quote specific timestamps and events from the timeline
- Reference goal/shot patterns as proof
- Identify recurring tactical themes
- Note successful and unsuccessful sequences

### COACHING FOCUS:
- Prioritize most impactful improvements
- Suggest realistic training methods
- Address both individual and team tactics
- Consider opponent analysis for next match
