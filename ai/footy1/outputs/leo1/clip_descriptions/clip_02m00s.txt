Here is a factual analysis of the 5-a-side football game:

The game begins with the player in orange standing in the goal, facing the play at 0:00. At 0:05, the player with orange bibs passes to the player in orange on the left. A player from Team A intercepts it and passes to a teammate who shoots at 0:11. The shot is taken from just outside the center circle. The ball travels low and straight towards the goal. The player in orange doesn't manage to intercept it as it goes into the goal.
