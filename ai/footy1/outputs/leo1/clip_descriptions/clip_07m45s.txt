Here's a factual analysis of the 5-a-side football action:

At [00:00:03], a player from Team A passes to his teammate near the center circle. A player in orange bibs intercepts the ball at [00:00:05], initiating a counter-attack. He advances towards the goal at the opposite end. At [00:00:09], from just outside the D, he shoots toward the top right corner. The ball curves slightly in the air. The goalkeeper from Team A makes no attempt to save it. The shot is off-target, narrowly missing the top corner. The ball continues off-screen. The play resumes with Team A in possession.
