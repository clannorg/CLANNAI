Alright! Here's a breakdown of the key events in the 5-a-side football video:

At [00:00:14], a player from Team A / non-bibs shoots from outside the D. The ball goes slightly over the goalie's head and into the net! It's a goal for the non-bibs. The other team is wearing orange bibs. Before the goal, at [00:00:13], Team A had gained possession.
