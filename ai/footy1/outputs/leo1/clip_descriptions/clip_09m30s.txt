Here's a breakdown of the 5-a-side game clip:

At 0:00, the ball is in the center circle. From 0:01 to 0:05, the non-bibs / colours team passes the ball between themselves in their own half of the field. At 0:06, the ball is passed forward to a player in white, who attempts to shoot, but the player with the orange bibs team intercepts the ball. From 0:07 to 0:14, the orange bibs team pass the ball between themselves and then passes to the player in orange in the middle of the field. The ball is passed forward and the orange bibs team takes control of the field.
