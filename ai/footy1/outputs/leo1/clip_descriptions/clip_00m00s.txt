Okay, here's a breakdown of the 5-a-side game clip:

At [00:00:05], a player from Team A (non-bibs) passes to a teammate near the center circle. The receiver attempts a through pass toward Team Aâ€™s attacking third. At [00:00:09], a player from Team B (orange bibs) intercepts the pass near the halfway line, taking possession. Team B player advances slightly. A player in orange bibs then attempts a through ball. This pass is intercepted by a Team A player in white. At [00:00:14], the white player dribbles forward slightly, and the play is still in the Team A half of the field.
