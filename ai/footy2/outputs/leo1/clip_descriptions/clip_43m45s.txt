At 0 seconds, the players are standing around the pitch in a casual manner, seemingly after a break in play. The ball is stationary near the center circle. A player in an orange bib and black shirt is bent over in the center circle.

At 10 seconds, a no bibs/colours player in a white t-shirt and black shorts gently kicks the ball forward from the center circle to restart play.

At 12 seconds, the ball is received by a teammate (no bibs/colours) in a black t-shirt.

At 13 seconds, the goalkeeper in the orange bib, who is standing in the goal, begins to walk forward toward the ball, which is now just outside his penalty area.
