Stats: 6+ goals, 20+ shots (~50% accuracy). Key moments: 11:10 (intercepted pass and instant goal), 35:30 (power shot off the crossbar and in), 49:17 (beautiful long-range finish). Signature: The 'No-Hesitation Strike,' shooting in one fluid motion. Weakness: Ambitious shot selection, sometimes ignoring a better passing option. Coach notes: Incorporate a final pass to draw defenders before assisting teammates; this would make him unstoppable.",
        "\u26a1 THE POWERHOUSE (8.0/10): Dark shirt, stocky build with a prominent beard - Target Forward. A physical presence creating space and unleashing thunderous strikes. Stats: 2 goals, 8 high-velocity shots. Key moments: 05:46 (blistering first-time shot), 08:49 (a fierce shot that hammered the crossbar and went in). Signature: The 'Frame-Shaker,' shots that test the goal's structural integrity. Weakness: Less involved in build-up play and can be isolated.
