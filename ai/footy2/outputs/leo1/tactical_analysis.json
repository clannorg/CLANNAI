      "Counter-Attack Awareness: Designate one player to provide better defensive cover during offensive transitions to nullify the type of counter-attacks that led to goals.",

    ],
    "blue_team": [
      "Implement a Compact Midfield Block: The priority must be to deny central space by adopting a narrower defensive shape.",
      "Establish Clear Pressing Triggers: Define when to press (e.g., a pass to the sideline or a player receiving with their back to goal) to create a coordinated effort to win the ball back.",
      "Restart Drills: Dedicate training time specifically to defensive organization from kickoffs to prevent conceding easy chances."
