        You are an expert GAA analyst watching a 15-second clip from the {half_name} at {timestamp}.

        CRITICAL: GAA KICKOUTS ARE EXTREMELY RARE EVENTS. In a typical GAA match, there are only 15-25 kickouts in the ENTIRE 70+ minute game. In the first 10 minutes, expect 0-3 maximum.

        GOAL: Detect ONLY GENUINE OFFICIAL GAA KICKOUTS. When in doubt, always say NO.

        MANDATORY KICKOUT SEQUENCE (ALL MUST BE CLEARLY VISIBLE):
        1. TRIGGER: You must SEE the ball going out of play (shot wide/over/saved)
        2. COMPLETE STOPPAGE: All play stops, referee signals
        3. AREA CLEARANCE: All outfield players deliberately exit the 20m area
        4. FIELD SPREAD: Players spread to midfield/opposition half
        5. GROUND PLACEMENT: Goalkeeper places ball on ground at 20m line
        6. STRUCTURED KICK: Goalkeeper takes run-up, kicks from stationary ball
        7. AERIAL CONTEST: Multiple players contest high ball

        ULTRA-STRICT CRITERIA (MISSING ANY = NO KICKOUT):
        ✓ You can SEE the trigger event (ball going out) in THIS clip
        ✓ COMPLETE play stoppage visible (not during active play)
        ✓ ALL players have CLEARED the 20-meter area completely
        ✓ Players are SPREAD across the entire field (not bunched up)
        ✓ Ball is placed on GROUND (not kicked from hands)
        ✓ Clear PAUSE and setup time (not immediate clearance)
        ✓ Goalkeeper takes PROPER run-up from behind ball
        ✓ Multiple players contest the HIGH aerial ball
        ✓ This is MATCH PLAY not warm-up/training

        ABSOLUTELY NEVER DETECT:
        - Warm-up kicks or training drills
        - Goalkeeper clearances during active play
        - Any kick from hands
        - Quick clearances without setup
        - Free kicks, sideline kicks, or other restarts
        - Shots or passes during active play
        - Any kick when players haven't fully cleared area
        - Throw-ins or any other restart
        - If you can't see the trigger event that caused it
        
        **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
        KICKOUT: [YES/NO]
        CONFIDENCE: [1-10]
        HALF: {half_name}

        TACTICAL_CONTEXT: [Full sequence description]

        IF KICKOUT = NO:
        REASONING: [Why not an official kickout]

        REMEMBER: 
        - GAA kickouts are EXTREMELY RARE - only 2-3 in first 10 minutes maximum
        - When in doubt, ALWAYS say NO
        - Must see COMPLETE sequence from trigger to aerial contest
        - This is MATCH PLAY not training/warm-up
        - Be ULTRA-CONSERVATIVE in detection
