You are analyzing a GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) football match from video clips. GAA matches have a specific structure:

GAA MATCH STRUCTURE:
- Pre-match warm-up (casual practice)
- FIRST HALF: 35+ minutes of competitive play
- HALFTIME BREAK: 10-15 minutes of casual warm-up/rest
- SECOND HALF: 35+ minutes of competitive play
- Post-match conclusion

Each half starts with an OFFICIAL THROW-IN CEREMONY by the referee in the center circle.

TASK: Analyze {len(description_files)} clips (00:00 to 84:00) to find the 4 key transition points.

STEP 1 - CATEGORIZE EVERY CLIP:
Go through each clip and categorize it as:

A) "PRE-MATCH" - Casual warm-up, loose practice, players gathering
B) "ACTIVE PLAY" - Competitive, fast-paced, tackles, scores, intense gameplay  
C) "HALFTIME BREAK" - Casual warm-up, players walking, practice kicks, relaxed
D) "THROW-IN CEREMONY" - Referee throws ball up between two players in center
E) "POST-MATCH" - Players leaving permanently, match concluded

STEP 2 - FIND CONTINUOUS BLOCKS:
Look for these temporal patterns:

1. PRE-MATCH block (casual)
2. Long ACTIVE PLAY block (30+ minutes of competitive play)
3. HALFTIME BREAK block (10-15 minutes of casual activity)
4. Long ACTIVE PLAY block (30+ minutes of competitive play)  
5. POST-MATCH conclusion

STEP 3 - IDENTIFY TRANSITIONS:
The 4 key moments are the TRANSITIONS between blocks:

1. FIRST HALF START = Last THROW-IN CEREMONY before long ACTIVE PLAY block
2. FIRST HALF END = When long ACTIVE PLAY transitions to HALFTIME BREAK
3. SECOND HALF START = THROW-IN CEREMONY that ends HALFTIME BREAK
4. MATCH END = When final ACTIVE PLAY block ends

ANALYSIS STRATEGY:
- Focus on DURATION and CONTINUITY of blocks
- A real half = 30+ minutes of continuous competitive play
- Halftime = 10-15 minutes of casual activity between competitive blocks
- Ignore isolated throw-ins during active play (these are just restarts)
- Look for the BIG PICTURE timeline, not individual moments

OUTPUT FORMAT:

TEMPORAL BLOCK ANALYSIS:

[List each clip with its category, like:]
00:00 - PRE-MATCH
00:15 - PRE-MATCH  
02:00 - THROW-IN CEREMONY
02:15 - ACTIVE PLAY
[continue for all clips...]

BLOCK SUMMARY:
Block 1: PRE-MATCH (00:00 - XX:XX)
Block 2: ACTIVE PLAY (XX:XX - XX:XX) [First Half]
Block 3: HALFTIME BREAK (XX:XX - XX:XX)
Block 4: ACTIVE PLAY (XX:XX - XX:XX) [Second Half]
Block 5: POST-MATCH (XX:XX - XX:XX)

KEY TRANSITIONS:

FIRST HALF START: [MM:SS]
Evidence: "[exact quote showing throw-in ceremony before sustained active play]"
Reasoning: "This throw-in ceremony is immediately followed by X minutes of continuous competitive play"

FIRST HALF END: [MM:SS]
Evidence: "[exact quote showing transition from active play to casual break]"
Reasoning: "After X minutes of continuous active play, players transition to casual halftime activities"

SECOND HALF START: [MM:SS]
Evidence: "[exact quote showing throw-in ceremony after halftime break]"
Reasoning: "This throw-in ceremony ends the halftime break and starts X minutes of continuous competitive play"

MATCH END: [MM:SS]
Evidence: "[exact quote showing definitive end of match]"
Reasoning: "After X minutes of second half play, the match concludes with players leaving permanently"

TIMELINE VERIFICATION:
First Half Duration: [X] minutes (should be 30+ minutes)
Halftime Break: [X] minutes (should be 10-15 minutes)
Second Half Duration: [X] minutes (should be 30+ minutes)

CRITICAL: Think like the web app - look for CONTINUOUS BLOCKS of activity, not individual moments. The GAA match structure is predictable: long competitive periods separated by a clear halftime break.
