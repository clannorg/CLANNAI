## 🔄 What Was Superseded

The old `/crm/superseded/` folder contains **63 scripts** that were replaced by these **4 essential scripts**:

- Multiple redundant scrapers → `club_scraper.py`
- Complex location tools → `location_sorter.py` 
- Various contact finders → `contact_finder.py`
- No clear workflow → `run_crm.py`

**The new version is 90% cleaner and 100% more reliable!**
