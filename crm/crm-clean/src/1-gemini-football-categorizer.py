1. ONLY include actual football/soccer clubs (exclude rugby, GAA, basketball, hockey, etc.)
2. Be very specific about locations: Northern Ireland vs Ireland vs England vs Scotland vs Wales
3. Exclude: schools, colleges, academies unless they are PRIMARILY football clubs
4. Exclude: rugby clubs (RFC), GAA clubs, basketball, hockey, cricket, etc.

For EVERY FOOTBALL CLUB found, provide this exact CSV format:
Club Name,Recordings,Club Identifier,Country,Sport,Additional Info

Countries must be specific:
- Northern Ireland (Belfast, Derry, Lisburn, Armagh areas)
- Ireland (Republic of Ireland only)
- England, Scotland, Wales
- United States, Germany, Japan, etc.

Sport must be: "Football" or "Soccer"

SKIP non-football clubs entirely - do not include them in your response.
