## Match Overview & Result

Chelsea Victory: Chelsea secured a narrow 2-1 win at home (Stamford Bridge) in this Premier League fixture.

Possession Doesn't Guarantee Ease: Despite Chelsea having more possession (52.7%) and significantly higher pass volume and accuracy, the close scoreline suggests West Ham were competitive and perhaps more clinical with their chances.

## Tactical Styles & Effectiveness

### Chelsea - Patient Possession & Volume

Dominated the ball with nearly 600 passes at a high completion rate (83.3%).

Their play involved a lot of horizontal passing (412 horizontal vs 49 forward passes), indicated as potentially "excess sideways passing lacking progression" in the imbalances section. This suggests a patient, perhaps sometimes slow, build-up.

Generated a high volume of shots (21), efficiently converting possession into attempts ("Shot Generation Efficiency" +232% deviation).

However, they only created 3 clear "Goal Chances," indicating many shots might have been lower quality or from distance.

### West Ham - Direct & Aggressive (Off the Ball)

Played significantly fewer passes (263) with lower accuracy (70.3%).

Were much more direct when in possession, indicated by a higher vertical passing ratio (0.23 vs Chelsea's 0.12).

Surprisingly created more "Goal Chances" (4) than Chelsea despite fewer shots (13) and less possession. This points towards greater efficiency or direct threat when they did attack.

Employed an extremely intense press (PPDA of 3.37), suggesting they tried to disrupt Chelsea high up the pitch. However, this press was inefficient, yielding a low ball recovery percentage (12.1%) despite numerous pressing actions (371). This high-energy, low-reward pressing might have been physically taxing.

### Additional Attack Patterns

Attack Patterns: Both teams used a mix of build-up play and counter-attacks, with build-up sequences being far more common for both, aligning with Chelsea's possession and West Ham's likely reaction phases. Neither team had high success rates from specific attack types listed (Build Up ~1.3-1.8%).

Crossing Ineffective: Both teams attempted crosses but with low success rates (around 5-6%), well below the benchmark, suggesting wide attacks culminating in crosses weren't particularly fruitful.

## Defensive Setup

Deep Blocks: Both teams are interpreted as using "Deep defensive blocks," defending close to their own goal.

West Ham's Defensive Workload: West Ham registered vastly more defensive actions (1067 vs 419) and significantly more instances of "Marking Opponents Inside The Box" (689 vs 164). This clearly shows they spent much more time in a structured defensive phase, absorbing Chelsea's pressure.

Chelsea's Pressing Efficiency: Chelsea's press was less intense (PPDA 9.51) but much more effective, recovering the ball on 26.1% of their pressing actions.

## Player Insights

### Chelsea's Backbone

The central defenders (Adarabioyo, Colwill) and defensive midfielders (Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez) were crucial in build-up, featuring heavily in passes and network centrality. Adarabioyo was a key hub (159 passes, highest centrality).

Enzo Fernandez and Caicedo covered significant distances (both ~11.7km).

Wingers like Madueke and Sancho were involved in progressive actions (take-ons, final third entries).

### West Ham's Key Figures

Midfielders Kudus and Soucek were vital. Kudus provided attacking threat (high take-ons, final third entries) and physical presence (high distance, top speed of 9.46 m/s). Soucek covered the most ground (11.9km) and contributed defensively.

The defence (Kilman, Coufal, Cresswell) was heavily involved, particularly defensively (Kilman 162 defensive actions, Coufal 82). Note: Coufal's high 'successful_take_ons' (115) seems unusual for a CB and might be a data anomaly or reflect specific situations.

Wan Bissaka was active defensively and physically as a wing-back.

## Key Takeaways & Narrative

This was a game where Chelsea controlled possession and territory (Field Tilt 60.2), passing the ball accurately but perhaps too laterally at times.

West Ham countered with a high-intensity but inefficient press and looked to be more direct and clinical when they had chances, managing to create more clear goal-scoring opportunities despite seeing less of the ball.

Chelsea's higher volume of shots and slightly better finishing (or perhaps West Ham errors) secured them the win, but West Ham's ability to create danger efficiently kept the scoreline close.

The significant difference in pressing efficiency was a key factor â€“ Chelsea won the ball back more effectively with less effort compared to West Ham's high-energy but less fruitful approach.
