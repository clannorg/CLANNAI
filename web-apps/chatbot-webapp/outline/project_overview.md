# Ognia Sports - Football Match Analysis Pipeline

## Project Overview
A data-driven approach to extract tactical insights from football match event data, optimized for LLM analysis.

## Problem Statement
Raw football match data contains thousands of discrete events but lacks structured tactical meaning. We need to transform this data into actionable insights.

## Our Approach

1. **Data Processing**
   - Parse raw JSON event data (~6,400 events per match)
   - Structure events into logical sequences and patterns
   - Calculate tactical metrics and benchmarks

2. **Analysis Pipeline**
   - Extract possession sequences and team patterns
   - Calculate comparative metrics against elite standards
   - Generate well-structured JSON output with tactical context

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Format data specifically for LLM consumption
   - Generate natural language interpretations alongside metrics
   - Produce tactical recommendations based on identified patterns

## Current Test Case
- Chelsea vs West Ham (2-1)
- Premier League, February 2025
- 6,426 events, 98 minutes match time

## Key Metrics Analyzed
- Possession sequences (build-up vs counter-attack)
- Passing patterns and directional bias
- Pressing efficiency and defensive organization
- Tactical imbalances against benchmarks
- Player networks and involvement

## Expected Outcome
A comprehensive, LLM-friendly analysis that transforms raw event data into tactical intelligence that coaches and analysts can immediately apply to improve team performance.
