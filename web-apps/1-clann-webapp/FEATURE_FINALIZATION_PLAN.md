### **🔥 Phase 2: Business Critical** *(2-3 hours remaining)*

### **1. Fix Turnover Filtering** ⚡ *FIRST - 30 minutes*
**Why First:** Marc has 78 turnovers but can't filter them - core feature broken

**Current:** Events exist in database but frontend filter UI missing turnover checkbox  
**Target:** Working turnover filter so Marc can see possession changes

#### Implementation:
- [ ] **Add turnover to eventTypeFilters state** - Include in initial state and reset
- [ ] **Add turnover checkbox** - "Turnovers" filter in UI
- [ ] **Test filtering** - Verify 78 turnover events show/hide correctly

#### Files to modify:
- `frontend/src/app/games/[id]/page.tsx` - Add turnover to filters

---

### **2. Payment Page for Marc/Greenisland** ⚡ *SECOND - 2-3 hours*
**Why Second:** Convert pilot customer to paying - business critical

**Current:** Marc using free trial, needs payment setup  
**Target:** Stripe payment page with pilot pricing guaranteed

#### Implementation:
- [ ] **Create payment page** - Simple Stripe checkout for Greenisland
- [ ] **Pilot pricing structure** - Grandfather current price permanently

#### Implementation:
- [ ] **Video clipping** - Extract event segments using FFmpeg

---

### **6. User Video Upload** ⚡ *SIXTH - 3-4 hours*
