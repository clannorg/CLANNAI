# 🏈 ClannAI Football Analysis Platform

A unified football analysis platform built with Next.js 15, combining the best features from both existing ClannAI applications into one modern, football-focused webapp.

## 🎯 **New Plan: Hybrid Solution**

### **What We're Building**
We're creating a **hybrid solution** that takes the best parts from both existing apps:

**From `web-app-clannai` (Backend):**
- ✅ **Real Express.js backend** with PostgreSQL
- ✅ **Working authentication** (JWT)
- ✅ **File upload to S3** 
- ✅ **Stripe payment integration**
- ✅ **Real database** with 55 users, 14 sessions
- ✅ **Complete API endpoints** for teams, sessions, auth

**From `clannai-frontend` (Frontend):**
- ✅ **Advanced video player** with event tagging
- ✅ **Professional dashboard** with tabs
- ✅ **Modern Next.js 15** with TypeScript
- ✅ **React Query** for state management
- ✅ **Professional UI components**

### **Why This Approach?**
- **Control**: We own the entire stack
- **Features**: Get the best of both worlds
- **Simplicity**: No external AWS dependencies
- **Cost**: No AWS charges, self-hosted
- **Flexibility**: Easy to modify and extend
