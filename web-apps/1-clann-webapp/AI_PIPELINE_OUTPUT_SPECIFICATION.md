## üéØ Team Color Mapping Rules

### AI Pipeline Output:
- Events use color identifiers: `"red"`, `"blue"`, `"white"`, `"black"`
- First team (home) = `"red"`
- Second team (away) = `"blue"`

### Jersey Color Names:
Use simple color names in metadata:
- ‚úÖ `"blue"`, `"red"`, `"white"`, `"orange"`, `"black"`, `"yellow"`, `"green"`
- ‚ùå `"blue and turquoise"`, `"non-bibs / colours"`

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

Before uploading, verify:

- [ ] All 4 files exist on S3
- [ ] All URLs in metadata are publicly accessible
- [ ] Events array has required `type` and `timestamp` fields
- [ ] Tactical analysis has `red_team` and `blue_team` objects
- [ ] Team names match between files
- [ ] Jersey colors are simple color names
- [ ] Timestamps are in seconds (not MM:SS format)

---

## üö® Common Errors to Avoid

1. **Missing URLs in metadata** - Causes 500 errors
2. **Wrong timestamp format** - Use seconds, not "15:30"
3. **Complex color descriptions** - Use simple color names
4. **Mismatched team names** - Keep consistent across files
5. **Missing required fields** - All marked fields are mandatory
