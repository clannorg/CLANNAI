## üõ£Ô∏è New Routes

### Dual Camera Route
```
/dashboard/basketball/games/{gameId}/dual-video/{primaryVideoId}/{secondaryVideoId}
```

   // Upload secondary camera feed (optional)
   // Wait for processing (status: processing ‚Üí ready)
   ```

3. **View Analysis**
   ```typescript
   // Single camera: /dashboard/basketball/games/{gameId}/video/{videoId}
   // Dual camera: /dashboard/basketball/games/{gameId}/dual-video/{primaryVideoId}/{secondaryVideoId}
   ```

## üéØ Benefits for Basketball Analysis

### Dual Camera Advantages

## üéÆ Testing

To test the dual camera feature:

1. Create a basketball game
2. Upload two video files
3. Wait for processing to complete
4. Navigate to the basketball dashboard
5. Click "Dual Camera" button
6. Test different layout modes and keyboard shortcuts
